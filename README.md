# Introduction
The Loan Approval Prediction project is a machine learning application that predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on historical data. It is designed to help financial institutions make more informed decisions, thereby reducing risks and improving efficiency.

# Features
* **Machine Learning Models:** Uses various machine learning algorithms for prediction.
* **Feature Engineering:** Processes categorical and numerical features for better model accuracy.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Measures model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Usage
* **Prepare the Dataset:** Ensure the dataset includes customer information such as income, credit history, loan amount, and more.
* **Run the Model:** After running the cells in the notebook, the system will train the models and display predictions.
* **Evaluate the Results:** The system provides accuracy scores and confusion matrices to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
  
# Dataset
The dataset used for this project should contain columns such as:

* ApplicantIncome
* CoapplicantIncome
* LoanAmount
* Loan_Amount_Term
* Credit_History
* Gender
* Married
* Education
* Self_Employed
* Property_Area
  
# Model Description
This project involves several key steps:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables.
* **Feature Engineering:** Preparing features for training the model.
* **Model Training:** Training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
* **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.
* **Prediction:** Using the trained model to predict loan approval for new applicants.
